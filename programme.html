      <h2>Comedy</h2>
      <p>Fierce, Feminist and Freaking Hilarious, Callie has performed across the UK and US. Having found exactly one grey hair near her forehead in 2016, Callie's comedy takes on adulthood as a millennial, expectations as THE WORST and the heartbreak we all experience as we face the endless void.</p>
